# README Generator

When building applications for clients, it is imperative to have a descriptive, clear and a user-friendly README markdown file that indicates installation procedures, instructions on how to use the app and other pertinent information about the app to give a casual experience for the user.  

This is an application using the CLI([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/)) to take user input and create a professional README markdown file for upcoming projects quickly.

## Installation 
The dependencies needed to run this application are the *File System* module included within node.js and the *inquirer.js* module.

To install the dependencies needed, run:
```
npm i
```

## Usage 
To invoke this application, navigate to the corresponding directory and run the following command:  
```
node index
```
The application will prompt the user with questions about the project. Once the user answers all the questions, a *README.md* file will be generated with the information the user has input.
